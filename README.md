Here is a Weather Dashboard created in Jquery. User inputs a "city" in the input field. When button clicked, current weather with five day forcast appears. 

# Questions that came about 

 At first, I couldn't do the icons correctly. Then searched and found another solution by downloading icons needed and use the right one when per weather API icon code.
